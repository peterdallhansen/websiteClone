      fullDescription: `**About Us**

We’re a fast-scaling AI startup developing cutting-edge computer vision software that is transforming the European market for traditional footfall analytics. Our mission is to bring real-time, intelligent insights to the physical world of shopping centers, retail, and airports through robust, scalable, and GDPR-compliant technology.

We're small, agile, and moving fast—with real customers, European traction, and big ambitions. Now, we’re looking for a talented Data Scientist who’s ready to be part of something early and meaningful, and who wants to play a direct role in shaping where this company goes next.

**Why You’ll Love It Here**

If you love moving fast, wearing many hats, and seeing your code solve real business problems in days, not years, you’ll feel right at home.

In a larger organization, you might spend years refining pre-established plans. Here, you'll play an active role in shaping our roadmap, working closely with the founders, influencing product decisions, and quickly seeing your models in production.

And for the right candidate who demonstrates an “all-in” mindset, strong technical skills, and an outgoing, collaborative DNA, there’s a real opportunity to join our equity program and share in the company’s long-term success as we scale.

**Who You Are**

You thrive on solving real-world problems with data and have the technical chops to back it up. You approach challenges with curiosity and clarity, and you communicate in a friendly, down-to-earth way that keeps the team aligned and energized. You don’t take yourself too seriously—your quick wit helps break the ice and keep things fun when the pressure’s on. You value collaboration, ownership, and a long-term mindset, and you’re excited to see your work move from idea to production in days, not years.

You’re likely:

A final-year master’s student or recent graduate with up to 2 years of hands-on experience

From a quantitative background—Data Science, Machine Learning, Mathematics, Statistics, or similar

Motivated to build real-world AI systems and curious about how software and business intersect

Most importantly, you want to join a small, mission-driven team where your ideas matter, your impact is immediate, and you can grow alongside the company—all while maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

**What You’ll Do**

Design, train, and optimize AI models and predictive analytics by means of mathematical and statistical modeling

Handle real-world, messy data—image, video, time-series, graphs, and more

Work closely with engineers and business stakeholders to solve practical, customer-facing problems

Contribute to a growing codebase and help lay the technical foundations of the company

Take ownership and push projects from idea to production quickly

Be a key voice in product and technical direction as we grow

**What You Bring**


Strong skills in Python and data science libraries

An analytical mindset comfortable with data, statistics, mathematical modeling, and structured problem-solving

A collaborative attitude, strong communication skills, and the ability to work in a team

Real motivation to grow in a startup and contribute across both technical and product discussions

Bonus: cloud experience (Azure, GCP, AWS), or interest in edge deployment, privacy-safe AI, or scalable MLOps

**What We Offer**





A front-row seat in a fast-moving AI startup with big goals and real momentum

The chance to learn, grow, and shape a product that’s changing how businesses understand offline customers and maximize their financial potential

Close collaboration with an experienced founding team

Real equity-like upside through an ambitious stock-option program for the right candidate

Flexible setup, fair compensation that mirrors where we are on our growth journey, and a work culture built on trust, speed, and shared success`,

**About Us** 

We're a fast-scaling AI startup developing **cutting-edge computer vision software** that’s transforming how retail, malls, and airports understand customer behavior. Our mission is to bring **real-time, GDPR-compliant insights** to physical spaces—unlocking smarter operations and better business outcomes through AI. 

With active customers across Europe and an agile, ambitious team, we’re now looking for a **Customer Success Manager** who can help ensure our customers not only succeed with our product—but love using it. 

**Why You’ll Love It Here** 

This isn’t a typical customer success role. Here, you’ll be part of the **core team**, working closely with founders, product, and engineering to ensure our customers’ expectations are exceeded. You’ll shape how we onboard, support, and grow our customer relationships from the ground up. 

In return, you’ll get the chance to grow with us, take on real responsibility, and—if the fit is right—**participate in our warrant (equity) program** as we scale. 

**What You’ll Do** 

*   Own the post-sales customer journey: onboarding, training, and ongoing relationship management 
    
*   Serve as the trusted point of contact for our clients—ensuring they get value, fast 
    
*   Identify customer pain points, translate them into feature requests or process improvements, and advocate for their needs internally 
    
*   Work closely with sales and product development to improve the full customer lifecycle 
    
*   Drive product adoption, customer satisfaction, and long-term retention 
    
*   Help us design and continuously improve a scalable, self-onboarding process for our software 
    

**Who You Are** 

You’re empathetic, structured, and naturally customer-focused. You communicate clearly—whether in writing, on calls, or in-person—and you’re the kind of person people trust quickly. You love helping others succeed and get energy from turning feedback into action. 

You might come from customer success, consulting, account management, shopping centre management or leasing management, or a hybrid role—but what matters most is your **ability to connect with people, understand technical products, and make things happen**. 

**What You Bring** 

*   Likely 1–3 years of experience in customer success, client-facing roles, or consulting 
    
*   Strong communication and relationship-building skills—you're proactive and personable 
    
*   A natural problem-solver who enjoys working with tech and data-driven tools 
    
*   Comfortable navigating cross-functional teams (e.g., product, engineering, sales) 
    
*   Bonus: experience in SaaS, retail tech, or early-stage startups 
    

**What We Offer** 

*   A front-row seat in a high-impact AI startup that’s changing an industry 
    
*   A key role where your work directly shapes customer happiness, loyalty, and growth 
    
*   Close collaboration with a small, driven team that values speed, trust, and clarity 
    
*   Real upside through our **warrant/equity program** for candidates who are all-in 
    
*   Flexibility, autonomy, and a culture that rewards initiative`,
